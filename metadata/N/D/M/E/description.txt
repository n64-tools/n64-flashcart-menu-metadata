You Killed The Demons Once, They Were All Dead. Or So You Thought... A single Demon Entity escaped detection. Systematically it altered decaying, dead carnage back into grotesque living tissue. The Demons have returned - stronger and more vicious than ever before. Your mission is clear, there are no options: KILL OR BE KILLED!
