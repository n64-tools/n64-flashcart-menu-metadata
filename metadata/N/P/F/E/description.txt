Professor Oak needs your help! The professor has asked you to capture the Wild Pokémon of Pokémon Island... on film! Tour the island in your ZERO-ONE vehicle and snap pictures of Pokémon in their natural habitat. Wild Pokémon are often camera-shy, so you'll have to use special items to bring them out in the open. Only the best shots will do for the Professors Pokémon Report. So sharpen your photography skills and get ready to SNAP!
